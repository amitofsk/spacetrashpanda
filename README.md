Entry for Space Apps 2021

All code was written by: Nikolas Pensyl

Thanks for taking time to view our submission for the Space Apps 2021 challenge. 

If you wish to directly run this program download the "build-Space_Simulation-Desktop_Qt_5_15_2_MinGW_64_bit-Release". After full download of the folder open it and your looking for the, "release" folder which has the executable. The executable will be name "Space_Simulation".

If you wish to play around with our code or just admire it, you can use many text editors to look at the files; however you will need Qt(Version 4 or better is what I suggest) inorder to actually play around and complile the code.

From all of us trash pandas we wish good fun with this project.
